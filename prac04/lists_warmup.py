"""numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]

1.numbers[0]
2.numbers[-1]
3.numbers[3]
4.numbers[:-1]
5.numbers[3:4]
6)5 in numbers
7)7 in numbers
8)"3" in numbers
9)numbers + [6, 5, 3]

Ans:
Q1)The value of numbers[0] is 3.
Q2)The value of numbers[-1] is 2.
Q3)The value of numbers[3] is 1.
Q4)The value of numbers[:-1] is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]. This is a slice of the numbers list that includes all elements except the last one.
Q5)The value of numbers[3:4] is [1]. This is a slice of the numbers list that includes the element at index 3, but excludes the element at index 4.
Q6)The expression is 5 in numbers. This will return True if 5 is in the list, and False otherwise.
Q7)The expression is 7 in numbers. This will return False because 7 is not in the list.
Q8)The expression is "3" in numbers. This will return False because "3" is not in the list. Note that the list numbers contains integer values, not string values.
Q9)The value of numbers + [6, 5, 3] is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3]. This is a new list that contains the elements of numbers followed by the elements [6, 5, 3].

Note:
    Cher, I will put my explanation here to state out my logic, if i am wrong please correct me in learnJCU

regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
I think i did improve quite a bit from the practicals. Accuracy wise, i still need help with certain issues like writing a function. The thinking process will take 
quite awhile. 

regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
I tend to overthink writing a code. So, while doing reviews, I am able to see different people using different method of writing a code and try to understand
what,how and why they are writing the code in this way. And for being reviewed,people can see what is wrong with our code and when they question us about it, it forces
us to think even more. 

regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I think i will make it slightly more objective based, for example one question for one function. In this way, students can actually do it step by step and not
just doing the whole chunk of codes.
